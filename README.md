Created  two playgrounds in order to demonstrate how to:
- Get the JSON response of the openWeather API
- Extract the today weather (min and max)

I included the Weather JSON on a file because the API key was not available in two hours.


On the secon playground I demostrate how to perform the internet query to get the same info.
